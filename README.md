# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction
Using various machine learning techniques, I designed a ML regression model for predicting the prices of used vehicles. The model was trained on several attributes i.e. car specifications such as mileage, engine displ, output power, year and place of manufacture etc., thus predicting the prices with over 90% accuracy.
